# calc.py
Simple arithmetic calculator in Python. This is one of my first projects in Python and is also offering me an opportunity to practice my Git commands and some object-oriented programming!

GUI.py creates the graphical interface with callbacks, implemented as a subclass of tkinter.Tk(). main.py and main.pyw instantiate this class to open the program.

This calculator is basically modeled on the arithmetic functions of the standard Windows utility calc.exe. At present the only issue of which I'm aware is floating-point arithmetic: E.g., 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3000...004, not 0.3. I may fix this and add further functionality at some point.

**Feedback is welcome!**
